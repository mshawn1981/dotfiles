# dotfiles
My personal configuration files for linux or unix systems

## Instructions

### Install VIM
* If you are using Suse 12, you should be able to install VIM via the web browser by searching for **"VIM Install Suse 12"**.  
	* **NOTE:**  VIM may not be installed as a default, so if you don't have it installed, this dotfile will probably not work.  

### Downloading the Files
* In the upper right of the page, there should be a green button, click the **Clone or Download** button.
* A drop-down menu should appear, click **Download ZIP** *(the files should begin to download to your **Downloads** folder)*.  
* Navigate to the **Downloads** folder
* Right-click the file and select either **Extract Here** or **Open with Archive Manager** from the context menu. *(this may be differnt on different versions of Linux)*
* Copy or drag the **.vimrc** file into your **Home** directory.
* Restart VIM session and you should see some noticeable changes.  
* Enjoy your new setup!!

Also, if you want to know what all the configuration has you can look at the .vimrc file in vim and see all the settings that have been changed.  There are many more settings that can be changed, this is only what I consider the bare bones settings to make VIM comparable to other text editors.  If you want to find more, the best way I've found is googling for "vimrc example" and just look at other configurations.
