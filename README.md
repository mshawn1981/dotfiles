# dotfiles
My personal configuration files for linux or unix systems

## Instructions
- to use the dotfiles that are in this repository you must download the files and then change them from a standard to a dotfile with the "." at the beginning of the file in your home directory.  This will allow you to have the same settings that I am using.
